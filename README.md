Dashboard: KAPI includes an intuitive interface that allows user to review their past advisory reports. Users can input data and configure any report parameters within the report. The dashboard also includes an inbox to notify you when your report has been certified by a KPMG consultant along with a calender feature that allows you to schedule an appointment with a consultant either virtually or in-person.

Progress Updates: Real-time updates on the progress of the report generation.

Visual Presentation:  A visually appealing layout to present your dashboard if you are a registered user. There is also a landing page that represents KPMG, which is introducing their new AI technology, KAPI and an individual page to further explain KAPI with the option to allow users to generate their free report trial. Once the user selects the option to generate their free report, they will be moved to a survey page to fill out their contact information and any other additional information required to develop the generated report. Once the report has been generated, only one page will be presented on the PDF viewer, and users will have to register for the service to view the rest of the report.

Customization Options: Options to customize their response on the survey and the ability to cutomize their appointments with their consultants.
